Meet **Consentacles** a minimalist framework for building fast web sites and apps.

## Quick Start
We're only on v0.1.0 so there is a very limited set of fuctions.

**Create a new Consentacles project**
$ consentacles new project <name>

**Build your Consentacles project**
$ consentacles build
(you must be inside the Consentacles project directory)

**Serve your Consentacles project**
$ consentacles server (localhost|lan|<address>) (port)
By default it serves to http://localhost:8080
If you want to the site from any device in the local area use:
$ consentacles serve lan
Or set your own custom address and port if that's how you roll
